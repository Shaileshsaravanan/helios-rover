# Helios Rover Project

## Project Overview

The **Helios Rover** is a work-in-progress project aimed at creating a fully autonomous rover equipped with a web-based interface for remote control and data visualization. The rover will utilize various sensors and actuators, and is designed to be controlled via a Flask-based web application. The project is still under development, and as it progresses, all components and documentation will be fully updated and operational.

## Repository Structure

- **3D Structural Stuff**
  - This folder contains the 3D files required for the physical assembly of the Helios Rover. These files are essential for constructing the rover's body and mounting various components.

- **Base_Code**
  - This folder includes the basic implementations of various functions that will be integrated into the rover's control system. The code here provides the foundational logic for the rover's operations, but is not yet fully functional.

- **Webapp**
  - The webapp folder hosts a Flask-based web application designed to interface with the Helios Rover. The web app will allow users to remotely control the rover and view real-time data from its sensors. As the project develops, this application will be expanded with more features and improved user experience.

- **Helios**
  - This folder contains the `helios.ino` file, which is the main Arduino code that will run on the rover. The code currently implements basic functionality and will be enhanced as the project progresses.

## Work in Progress

Please note that this project is currently under development. The code, 3D models, and web application are not yet finalized, and some features may not work as intended. Updates will be made as the project moves towards completion.

## Future Updates

- Complete integration of sensor data and actuator controls.
- Enhancements to the Flask web application for better user interaction.
- Optimization of the `helios.ino` code for improved performance.
- Finalization of the 3D model for the rover structure.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to work on the Helios Rover project!
